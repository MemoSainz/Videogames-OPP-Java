</div>

    1. Collections (arraylist)
    2. atributes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The practice was meant to be about creating a class called "Videogames", with the next attributes: ID, title, console, number of players, category... having in mind all the attributes, constructors, methods and getters & setters.
> 
> Creating an ArrayList of 5 games, and saving them inside the collection
> 
> Loop the ArrayList created and show in the screen the title, console and number of players of the games saved.
> 
> Change the name and number of plaayers of the games. Later showing them in the console.
> 
> Go through the ArrayList ad show in the screen alone, the videogammes of the console Nintendo 64.
